    Need to make it so view ports can be enlarged, and that we can remove view ports... It probably would've
    been easier to do the views with actual game maker views, but I don't think they'd do what we need...
    Also, this system allows US to decide when the views should update, so we can control when stuff renders and other things.
    
      
    Need to make more windows widgets:
        File Menus,
        Status Bar,
        Buttons,
        Check boxes.
        
        
    I should probably make the views actually have something in them, it's set up so they can be rendered into,
    but I just haven't bothered due to the perspectives and such.
    
    
    The following stuff comes much later:
    
        Make it so we can switch between different work spaces (Currently we only have room editor):
            Room Editor,
            Object Editor,
            Material Editor,
            Sound Editor,
            (Maybe) Model Editor/converter,
            (Maybe) Script Editor,
            (Maybe) Shader Creator.
